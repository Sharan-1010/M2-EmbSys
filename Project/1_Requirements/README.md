# Abstract:
This project  implements automatic hand sanitizer for preventing bacteria's and germ's present in the hands before entering a building. Hands are considered to be the primary mode of infectious diseases, especially for those living in close proximity such as college residence halls, shopping malls, bank halls, market areas etc. Because of the frequent contact with hands and multiple surfaces, the incidence of cross-contamination is significantly increased, with this project the contamination of disease is reduced and prevented. This system does not the person without using the hand washer. The hand washer contains sanitizer which prevents most of the germs present in hands. This system is connected with the door of the entrance with electromagnetic lock which locks and open the door with the help of servo motor.
___
## SWOT Analysis:
## Strength:
1. Requires less time to wash the hands.
2. Does not allow anyone without sanitizing the hands.
3. Reduces the risk of getting affected to germs.
## Weakness:
1. Needs power supply frequently.
2. Usage of water may increase.
3.  Water may affect the circuit.
## Opportunities:
1. They have greater accuracy than any other methods of sanitizing the hands.
2. Ultrasonic sensors are easy to use and not harm to anyone.
3. This system can be used any buildings to aviod germs and diseases.
## Threats:
1. Limited testing distance of hands.
2. Inflexible scanning methods.
3. The system may get damaged to water.
